# Hello-World
First Repository made on Github

I'm a teen who's learning Python at the moment- and  has suscessfully learnt html and css for front-end.
This is 2021 which is supposed to be my first year at University
But because of cruel greedy military junta, i haven't took the final yet.
When you look at this, i hope you feel the pain i have now. 
I hope my future self will be doing a lot greater than i do right now.
bye.
